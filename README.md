# README

The idea here is to build a simple REST API for a CRUD of users.

And we know we need to keep an record of:

- name
- age
- email
- password
- address

## Implementation decisions

Using Go 1.x

Persistence in NoSql MongoBB.

Though not included at the initial time, we may add later:
- Unit tests
- Authentication for the API.
